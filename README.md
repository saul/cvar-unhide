# cvar-unhide [![CI](https://github.com/saul/cvar-unhide/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/saul/cvar-unhide/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This Source Engine plugin reveals all console variables (convars/cvars) that are marked as hidden or development-only. The plugin can also set console variables to arbitrary values, bypassing any hard-coded minimum/maximum. Furthermore, console commands can be 'force dispatched' regardless of whether they are marked as hidden, cheat or development-only.

A list of all console variables/commands that are made available by this plugin can be found in [cvarlist-csgo.md](./cvarlist-csgo.md) and [cvarlist-portal2.md](./cvarlist-portal2.md).

> ### ðŸ’¡
>
> You must add `-insecure` to CSGO's launch options for the game client to load plugins.
> The plugin will not load without this command-line argument set.

## Supported games

- Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
